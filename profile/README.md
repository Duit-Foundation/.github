# Duit - drived UI tooklit.

***Duit*** is a server side UI framework for Flutter. It is used for creating widgets and server-side state management.

The framework ensures that the layout model is received from the server, interacts with the backend via the Action API, and embeds custom components into the widget hierarchy processing pipeline. Duit is flexible and extensible, which allows it to create rich UI dynamically.
